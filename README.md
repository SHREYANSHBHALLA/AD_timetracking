# Ad Time Tracking with DeepSORT and YOLOv8

This project tracks advertisement boards and key objects (like players and sports balls) in sports videos using object detection and multi-object tracking. It uses **YOLOv8** (for ad detection), **Faster R-CNN** (as an alternative for object detection), and **DeepSORT** for robust tracking across frames.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To generate a processed video where:
- Ad boards are detected and tracked over time.
- Player and ball movement is tracked.
- The video is annotated with bounding boxes and unique object IDs.
- This tracking allows for **ad exposure time measurement** and **scene analytics**.
